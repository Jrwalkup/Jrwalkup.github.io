Students often struggle to maintain their motivation when studying for assignments and tests, and most tools only aid in keeping track of deadlines instead 

of encouraging long-term study habits. Many students never learned to study effectively or have picked up habits that are counterintuitive to learning and retaining information.  A study app that keeps up with 

academic progress, deadlines, and gives the user tips for effective learning would make learning and school much easier for many people.
